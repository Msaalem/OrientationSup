[OrientationSup](http://orientationsup.atwebpages.com)

This website allows students to get university orientation based on their grades, the availability of university spots, their preferences, and the ranking of students. 

The website offers several features for both students and administrators (universities). 

Students can log in and get orientation, submit their choices, and check their results on their profile. 

Administrators can also create an orientation, specify the number of available spots, calculate the ranking grade and eliminatory mark, as well as other features. They can input this data manually or upload an Excel file for automatic filling in. After the orientation is done, administrators can also download the results in Excel format.

The orientation program is based on a mathematical algorithm called stable matching. This algorithm takes into account the ranking of students and their preferences in order to generate an optimal placement that is mutually beneficial to both the university and the student.
